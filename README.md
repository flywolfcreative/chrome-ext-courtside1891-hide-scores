# Chrome Extension: Hide scores for finished games on Courtside1891

Don't you just hate it when a big Basketball tournement is on, and a game happens whilst you're at work. You spend all day avoiding any possible source of news of the game because you want to watch it after work as if its happening real time. You log into Courtside1891, find the game and oh look - the scores are right there. Great. Your disappointment is immeasurable and your day is ruined. 

I made this simple extension so that it blurs out the scores when you're browsing for a game and it doesn't bold the winner. So you can be blissfully ignorant of what has happened and fully enjoy the full replay of the game, enjoying the excitement and stress to see your favorite team try to win without already knowing the outcome. 

Sidenote: Courtside1891, if you're reading this, why isn't this already built into your website????????
